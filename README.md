## Flux Comment

This is an example app built with the Flux pattern. It's really a broken down re-write of the [Flux Chat](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat) example.

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm start`

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will
update build.js with any changes you wish to make.  This watcher is
based on [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and
[Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify), and it transforms
React's JSX syntax into standard JavaScript with
[Reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify).

After starting the watcher, you can open `index.html` in your browser to
open the app.
